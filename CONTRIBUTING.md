ðŸŽ‰ **Thanks for your interest in helping improve Streamlit!** ðŸŽ‰

Before contributing, please read our guidelines here: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Contributing

As with most projects, prior to starting to code on a bug fix or feature request, **please post in the respective Github issue saying you want to volunteer, and then wait for a positive response.** And if there is no issue for it yet, create it first.

This helps make sure (1) two people aren't working on the same thing, (2) this is something Streamlit's maintainers believe should be implemented/fixed, (3) any API, UI, or deeper architectural changes that need to be implemented have been fully thought through by the community together with Streamlit's maintainers.
