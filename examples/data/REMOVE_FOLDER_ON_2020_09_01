These files have since been moved to https://github.com/streamlit/hello-data.

However, since the Github URL for these files used to be referenced inside
`streamlit hello` up to Streamlit v0.57.2, for backward compatibility we
should not remove these files from the repo for another 6 months. So that's
September 2020.

See you then!
