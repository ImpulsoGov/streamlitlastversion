"""Update version number across the entire repo.

If the current version is 0.15.2 and I wanted to create a release for
local development, ie make a wheel file and make either a conda or pex
package to test on OSX or linux.  What should I call the next version?

If its a patch change, then its just the third number being edited. If
its a minor change then its the second number.  In this example, we're
doing a patch change.

The public released dev version would be
0.15.3-dev0

For local development it would be
0.15.3-dev0+USERNAME0

If you iterate your local dev version it would then be
0.15.3-dev0+USERNAME1

You then release it for testing.
0.15.3-dev0

Someone finds a bug so you release a new internal version for testing.
0.15.3-dev1+USERNAME0

Then we can go to alpha, rc1, rc2, etc. but eventually its
0.15.3
